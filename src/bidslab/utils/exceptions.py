class FieldEntryNotValidError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when an individual metadata value is semantically invalid.

    This exception is suitable for situations in which a field is present but its
    value violates allowed content constraints, controlled vocabularies, or expected
    formatting rules.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldNotValidError`
        Raised when the field name itself is not valid.
    :py:class:`FieldMissingError`
        Raised when a required field is absent entirely.

    Notes
    -----
    Use this exception when the field itself is recognized but one specific entry is
    unacceptable.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise FieldEntryNotValidError("SamplingFrequency must be positive.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FieldEntryNotValidError: SamplingFrequency must be positive.
    """

    pass


class FieldMissingError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when a required metadata field is absent.

    This error typically signals a BIDS compliance violation for mandatory entries in
    JSON sidecars, TSV columns, or ``dataset_description.json``.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldMissingWarning`
        Warning counterpart for recommended but non-mandatory fields.
    :py:class:`FileMissingError`
        Raised when the missing resource is a file rather than a field.

    Notes
    -----
    Prefer this exception over :py:class:`FileMissingError` when the missing item is a
    logical field within an otherwise accessible file or object.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise FieldMissingError("Required field 'Name' is missing.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FieldMissingError: Required field 'Name' is missing.
    """

    pass


class FieldMissingWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when a recommended metadata field is absent.

    This warning is useful for soft validation paths where the dataset remains usable
    but would benefit from additional descriptive metadata.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldMissingError`
        Hard-failure counterpart for required fields.

    Notes
    -----
    Typical examples include optional BIDS fields that improve interoperability or
    documentation quality without being strictly required.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("Consider adding License.", FieldMissingWarning)
    """

    pass


class FieldNotValidError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when a field name or attribute is not recognized.

    The exception is commonly used when external metadata contains keys that cannot
    be mapped to supported attributes or BIDS fields.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldEntryNotValidError`
        Raised when the field exists but contains an invalid value.
    :py:class:`FieldPresentError`
        Raised when a field is present even though it must be omitted.

    Notes
    -----
    Use this exception for invalid field identifiers rather than invalid values.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise FieldNotValidError("Field FooBar is not valid in Dataset")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FieldNotValidError: Field FooBar is not valid in Dataset
    """

    pass


class FieldPresentError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when a disallowed field is present.

    This typically occurs when two metadata sources are mutually exclusive and one of
    them should be omitted according to project or BIDS rules.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldPresentWarning`
        Warning variant for discouraged but tolerated fields.
    :py:class:`FieldNotValidError`
        Raised when the field name is unsupported rather than merely disallowed here.

    Notes
    -----
    In strict validation flows this class signals a hard error, whereas
    :py:class:`FieldPresentWarning` may be used for tolerated cases.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise FieldPresentError("Authors must be omitted when CITATION.cff is present.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FieldPresentError: Authors must be omitted when CITATION.cff is present.
    """

    pass


class FieldPresentWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when a field is present but should ideally be omitted.

    The warning supports non-fatal validation scenarios in which duplicate or
    redundant metadata is tolerated but highlighted for cleanup.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldPresentError`
        Hard-failure counterpart for disallowed fields.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn(
    ...     "License should be omitted when CITATION.cff is present.",
    ...     FieldPresentWarning
    ... )
    """

    pass


class FileMissingError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when a required file is absent.

    Typical use cases include missing BIDS root files such as
    ``dataset_description.json`` or other mandatory companions.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FileMissingWarning`
        Warning counterpart for recommended files.
    :py:class:`FieldMissingError`
        Raised when the missing item is a field instead of a file.

    Notes
    -----
    Use this exception for filesystem-level requirements rather than missing metadata
    within an existing file.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise FileMissingError("dataset_description.json file is missing.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    FileMissingError: dataset_description.json file is missing.
    """

    pass


class FileMissingWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when a recommended file is absent.

    This class is intended for optional documentation or auxiliary files whose
    absence should be communicated without aborting processing.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FileMissingError`
        Hard-failure counterpart for required files.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("CHANGES file is recommended.", FileMissingWarning)
    """

    pass


class FileNotFoundWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when an expected file path cannot be resolved.

    Unlike :py:class:`FileMissingError`, this warning is appropriate when the missing
    path does not necessarily invalidate the dataset but may affect optional
    processing steps.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FileMissingError`
        Exception for required missing files.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("Optional calibration file was not found.", FileNotFoundWarning)
    """

    pass


class FileTypeUnsupportedWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when a discovered file uses an unsupported extension.

    This warning is typically emitted during companion-file discovery when a file
    shares the expected base name but does not conform to the supported set of file
    formats.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`MultipleFilesFoundWarning`
        Warning raised when too many supported candidates are found.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn(
    ...     "Only .tsv[.gz] and .json are supported.",
    ...     FileTypeUnsupportedWarning
    ... )
    """

    pass


class InvalidURIError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when a URI fails syntactic validation.

    This exception is used for metadata values that should be resolvable or at least
    syntactically well-formed URIs, such as homepage links, DOI URLs, or ontology
    references.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldEntryNotValidError`
        More general exception for semantically invalid field values.

    Notes
    -----
    The associated checks validate URI syntax, not whether the referenced resource is
    reachable.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise InvalidURIError("Value 'not a url' is not a valid URI.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    InvalidURIError: Value 'not a url' is not a valid URI.
    """

    pass


class MultipleFilesFoundError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when more than one mutually exclusive file is present.

    This typically indicates that the dataset contains ambiguous top-level resources,
    such as multiple README files, where only one authoritative file should exist.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`MultipleFilesFoundWarning`
        Non-fatal counterpart used when validation is overridden.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise MultipleFilesFoundError("README file is already present.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    MultipleFilesFoundError: README file is already present.
    """

    pass


class MultipleFilesFoundWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when multiple candidate files are found but execution continues.

    This warning usually indicates that the first discovered matching file is used as
    a fallback while the remaining candidates are ignored.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`MultipleFilesFoundError`
        Exception counterpart for strict validation.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn(
    ...     "Multiple JSON files found. Using the first one found.",
    ...     MultipleFilesFoundWarning
    ... )
    """

    pass


class PathsSameWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when source and destination paths are identical.

    It is typically emitted by file-copy helpers to indicate that the requested
    operation would be a no-op and has therefore been skipped.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FileNotFoundWarning`
        Warning for missing optional file paths.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("Source and destination paths are the same.", PathsSameWarning)
    """

    pass


class TopLevelEntityNotLinkedWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when a top-level entity cannot be linked automatically.

    This warning is relevant for object-population workflows in which entity metadata
    may be partially known but not yet connected to the corresponding top-level data
    structures.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`FieldNotValidError`
        Exception raised when the target field itself is invalid.

    Notes
    -----
    Some helper functions intentionally suppress this warning during bulk attribute
    assignment.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn(
    ...     "Top-level entity could not be linked.",
    ...     TopLevelEntityNotLinkedWarning
    ... )
    """

    pass


class VersionMismatchError(Exception):
    """
    Exception raised when expected and observed versions differ.

    In aBIDSkit this is primarily used for BIDS specification version mismatches that
    can affect compatibility or validation outcomes.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`VersionMismatchWarning`
        Warning counterpart for tolerated mismatches.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> raise VersionMismatchError("Expected 1.10.0, found 1.9.0.")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    VersionMismatchError: Expected 1.10.0, found 1.9.0.

class VersionMismatchWarning(Warning):
    """
    Warning raised when versions differ but processing is allowed to continue.

    This warning communicates a compatibility risk without enforcing a hard stop.

    See Also
    --------
    :py:class:`VersionMismatchError`
        Exception raised for non-tolerated version mismatches.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import warnings
    >>> warnings.warn("BIDS version mismatch detected.", VersionMismatchWarning)
